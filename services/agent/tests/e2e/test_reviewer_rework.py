"""E2E 3: the reviewer catches deliberately bad output.

The writing specialist's first memo draft is fixture-corrupted — it cites
nothing ("trust me on the numbers"). The reviewer must reject it with
actionable feedback, the rework loop must re-dispatch the specialist with that
feedback, and the second attempt must pass.
