"""E2E 6: graceful recovery from agent failures.

A fixture forces the research specialist to call a nonexistent tool: the first
failure retries with a revised-approach instruction, the second failure
escalates, and at no point is the task left in an inconsistent state — it
pauses cleanly, keeps its working memory for the resume, and completes after a
human take-over.
